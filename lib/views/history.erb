                <p>
                    Forest Glade Football Club was founded in 1992 and has rapidly expanded to be one of the premier
                    youth football set-ups in the county.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The club has close to 300 members with players starting at aged 5 and progressing all the way to
                    adult football.

                <p>
                    In 2003 Forest Glade F.C. achieved the FA status of Charter Standard Development Club, one of only
                    15 in the county.
                    The Charter Standard shows that Forest Glade F.C. follows the FA�s best practice guide that sets
                    standards of coaching,
                    administration and child protection for clubs working with young people.

                <p>
                    All Forest Glade F.C. coaches, managers and officials that have any contact with young people are
                    CRB checked and the club has its own Club Welfare Officer to ensure a safe environment for all club
                    members.

                <p>
                    In July 2009 the club was awarded the Essex F.A. Charter Standard Development Club of the Year.

                <p>
                    The club has 25 teams for the season 2008/2009. The teams will be playing in the Mid Essex Football
                    League, the Chelmsford Youth Football League, the Southend and District Junior Sunday Football
                    League and the South East Essex Primary League.

                <p>
                    The club provides excellent playing and training facilities for its members which cover 13 acres.
                    The training facilities are now floodlight and the ground also has its own changing rooms with
                    showers, toilets, and a club house that provides refreshments on match days and Saturday training
                    sessions.

                <p>
                    The club supports the FA�s Get into Football Campaign. The campaign aims to ensure there are
                    opportunities for all to play the game and also engage people at all levels in off-the-field roles.
