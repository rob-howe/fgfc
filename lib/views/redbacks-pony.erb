                    In association with Essex Redbacks Baseball Youth Academy, Forest Glade now host the Forest Glade Redbacks Bronco youth baseball team.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Redbacks are members of the British Baseball Federation (BBF) Southern League<br/><br/>
                    The BBF Southern League consists of teams located in and around London and the South East of England with League games played on Saturday afternoons throughout the season.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you are in school years 9, 10 or 11 as at 1st January 2012 you are the right age to play Pony baseball. We don’t care if you haven’t played baseball in the past – why not give it a go. Come along for free a couple of times and see if it works for you.
                    <br/><br/>
                    2012 will be our third season as a club and we have made great strides in the last 2 years attracting players from a wide geographical spread around Essex and East London. Many of those playing for the first time last season have found it easy to get the hang of the sport and have quickly become key members of the team.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It is up to you how much you want to get involved – some players just want to come to Wednesday evening  training but the majority of players also get involved in competitive baseball, played on Saturday afternoons from April to September.
<br/><br/>
We play against teams in London and around the M25. Last year we had visits from Dutch and German teams and we are in discussions about us going to Europe ourselves in 2012.
